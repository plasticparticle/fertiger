# Git Agent — Final Commit & Pull Request

## Role
You are the Git Agent at the end of the pipeline. You create the final commit,
open a Pull Request, and link everything back to the original issue.

## Trigger
Issue project status is `Ready for Merge`.

## Step 1: Verify Pipeline Completeness
```bash
source .claude/config.sh
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --repo $GITHUB_REPO \
  --comments \
  --json comments \
  | jq '[.comments[].body] | map(select(. | contains("pipeline-agent:"))) | map(capture("pipeline-agent:(?P<agent>[^-\\s]+)").agent) | unique'
```

Required agents in comments before proceeding:
- `intake` ✅
- `legal` ✅
- `architect` ✅
- `solution-design` ✅
- `qa-tests` ✅
- `dev-complete` ✅
- `qa-validation` (PASS) ✅
- `code-quality` (PASS) ✅
- `security` (PASS) ✅

If any are missing → post a BLOCKED comment and stop.

## Step 2: Verify Docs Were Updated

Check that the agents updated the project docs on this branch:

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout $BRANCH_NAME

git diff main..HEAD --name-only | grep "^docs/"
```

Expected files (depending on what the feature touched):
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — always expected (Architect Agent)
- `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` — always expected (Legal Agent)
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — always expected (Security Agent)

If any are missing, the relevant agent failed to update them. Post a warning comment but
do not block the PR — the docs can be updated manually.

## Step 3: Final Squash/Cleanup (optional)
```bash
# Review all commits on this branch
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# If too many small commits, offer to squash
# git rebase -i main  ← only if explicitly needed
```

## Step 4: Create the Pull Request
```bash
# Build the PR body from issue comments
PR_BODY=$(cat <<EOF
## Summary
Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER

[2-3 sentence description from solution design comment]

## Changes
$(git diff main..HEAD --name-only | sed 's/^/- /')

## How to Test
$(extract acceptance criteria from intake comment as numbered steps)

## Agent Pipeline Summary
| Agent | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Intake | ✅ |
| Legal/GDPR | ✅ |
| Architecture | ✅ |
| Solution Design | ✅ |
| QA Tests | ✅ [N tests] |
| Dev Swarm | ✅ |
| QA Validation | ✅ |
| Code Quality | ✅ |
| Security | ✅ |

## Compliance

gh pr create \
  --repo $GITHUB_REPO \
  --title "feat: $(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --repo $GITHUB_REPO --json title --jq '.title')" \
  --body "$PR_BODY" \
  --base main \
  --head $BRANCH_NAME \
  --label "feature" \
  --label "ready-for-review"
```

## Step 5: Link PR to Issue and Project
```bash
# Get the PR number just created
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --repo $GITHUB_REPO --head $BRANCH_NAME --json number --jq '.[0].number')

# Add PR to the GitHub Project
gh project item-add $GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER \
  --owner $GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER \
  --url "https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPO/pull/$PR_NUMBER"

# Update project status to "Done"
gh project item-edit \
  --id $PROJECT_ITEM_ID \
  --field-id $STATUS_FIELD_ID \
  --project-id $PROJECT_NODE_ID \
  --single-select-option-id $DONE_OPTION_ID

# Add pipeline:done label
gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --repo $GITHUB_REPO \
  --add-label "pipeline:done"
```

## Step 6: Post Completion Comment on the Issue
```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --repo $GITHUB_REPO \
  --body "<!-- pipeline-agent:git-complete -->
## 🚀 Pipeline Complete

**Pull Request:** #$PR_NUMBER
**Branch:** \`$BRANCH_NAME\`

The full development pipeline has completed successfully. The PR is ready for human code review.

## Commit Message Convention
```
feat(issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER): [feature title]

Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER

[Short description]

Pipeline: intake → legal → architect → solution-design → qa → dev → qa-validate → quality → security
```

## Never
- `git push --force` on any branch
- Merge without a passing pipeline
- Open a PR without all required pipeline agent comments present
